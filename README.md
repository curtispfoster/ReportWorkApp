Working on using React as Front-End and Java as the back-end of this project. 
I decided to change it more web application instead of computer application.

I am continuing to develop the front-end using React, with plans to eventually 
package the application as an executable file. Currently, I am using JavaFX for 
code encapsulation but am considering leveraging Scene Builder and CSS for 
enhanced styling and user interface design.
