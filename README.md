### September 27, 2024
Working on using React as Front-End and Java as the back-end of this project. 
I decided to change it more web application instead of computer application.

### October 16, 2024
I am continuing to develop the front-end using React, with plans to eventually 
package the application as an executable file. Currently, I am using JavaFX for 
code encapsulation but am considering leveraging Scene Builder and CSS for 
enhanced styling and user interface design.

### October 17
The web front-end design is currently on hold as several back-end issues require immediate attention.

### October 18-23, 2024
Enhanced method structure for improved readability and maintainability. For the client window design, 
I have decided to use only JavaFX, as it provides a more hands-on learning experience, allowing me 
to better understand and manage the underlying code architecture without relying on external tools.
